Introduction

Welcome to the ft_irc project! As part of my journey at 1337 School, I have developed this IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server from scratch using C++. This project is a comprehensive exploration of computer networking and communication protocols, providing hands-on experience with the fundamentals of network programming.

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the ft_irc project. In this README, I will introduce you to the core concepts and provide a guide to understanding and running the IRC server. We will cover essential topics such as socket programming, connection management, and data exchange.

What You Will Learn
By exploring this project, you will gain a solid understanding of:

Socket Programming: Creating and managing sockets for network communication.
Connection Handling: Setting up a server to listen for and manage multiple client connections.
Data Exchange: Implementing protocols for message transmission between the server and clients.

Features
Socket Creation and Binding: Setting up sockets and binding them to specific ports.
Listening for Connections: Enabling the server to listen for and accept incoming client connections.
Client Interaction: Handling multiple clients and facilitating message exchange.
